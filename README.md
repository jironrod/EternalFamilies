TEKsystems Java Developer - Case Study

I have completed the full CRUD functionality of my app;

I have full stack developed my app with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Hibernate, Spring Security, and MySQL;

Fully functioning login and registration with built-in validation;

Many of my technical challenges came from simple typing errors;

Everything about my code was fully functional, but it was just a few spelling errors that got the best of me. Thanks, John for helping me there;

Implementing Thymeleaf was very new to me. I'm familiar with coding Java front-end with JSP files, but Thymeleaf was new to me. However, once fully understood and mastered, I've come to love to code with this dynamic HTML engine;

Utilizing Git and uploading my code on GitHub was a challenge for me. Git confused me very easily, so I became quickly discouraged. Nonetheless, after humbling myself and seeking out help from a peer programmer, he was able to teach me how to code Git fluidly and efficiently. Thank you, Derek;

Spring Security amirite? Not yet diving into the works of Spring Security, I was impressed by the comments and concerns of fellow programmers about the complexity, catastrophe, and confusion that can come from tackling such an endeavor. Luckily for me, my IA Kevin shared with us a playlist of videos by Java Guides. These videos plainly and perfectly explain the use of Spring Security in a Java web application. Much appreciated Kevin;

The ultimate challenge that I encountered was with JUnit testing. I just could not get that to work at all. I tried myself with one of Java Guides' videos - no success. Asked for help from my peers - to no avail. Nothing seemed to be working. And I know it had something to do with @Builder annotation with Lombok.

None of my personal weaknesses, screw-ups, or failures could have been readily resolved without the sustaining support of my wife and eternal companion
Shannon Sydney Rodriguez. I love you so much, sweetheart. You've lifted me up more than I could count. You have been my anchor. Without a doubt, I would not have made it this far in this life without the loving guidance and tender care that you've offered me. With Jesus Christ as our central focus, I know that no trials or tribulations may sway our path;
